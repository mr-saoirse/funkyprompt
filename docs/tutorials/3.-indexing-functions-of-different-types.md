# 3. Indexing functions of different types

In the previous section we discussed how to register functions that could be used by the agent. These functions were actually data store searches. Generally we can index any function including library functions and API calls. Lets jump into an example. This example will actually just wrap one of our stores just for illustration purposes. Keep in mind we can always call these stores through the already indexed functions but this is a good illustration. Also we could wrap the store searches with more specialized search parameters e.g. searching for only certain records or time periods

```python
import funkyprompt
from funkyprompt import describe_function

from funkyprompt.ops.examples.rag import get_information_on_fairy_tale_characters

fn = get_information_on_fairy_tale_characters
```

&#x20;We can describe this function to produce a function description

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```python
fd = describe_function(fn)
fd.factory
#FunctionFactory(name='get_information_on_fairy_tale_characters', module='funkyprompt.ops.examples.rag', partial_args={'type': 'default'})
```
{% endcode %}

As always, we can get the openai function descriptions with `fd.function_dict()`

We can register this function for search if we wish

```python
from funkyprompt import FunkyRegistry
reg = FunkyRegistry()
#register this function
reg.register_function(fn)  
```

Then we can search

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```python
#reg('a function for learning about fairy tale characters')

[{'_distance': 0.29409146308898926,
  'name': 'functions_funkyprompt_ops_examples_rag_get_information_on_fairy_tale_characters',
  'content': 'Provides details about fairy tale characters /n/nIn relation to entity default, function_subject_todo, funkyprompt.ops.examples.rag'},
 {'_distance': 0.3108857572078705,
  'name': 'vector-store/default/FairlyTales',
  'content': 'Classific Fairy tales - short stories about Snow White, Sinbad, etc /n/nIn relation to entity vector-store, FairlyTales, default'}]
```
{% endcode %}

Note that both the store that was previously indexed and this function come back as candidates - the LLM could use either or both

***

Under the hood the functions are loaded with&#x20;

```
FucntionDescription.restore(<DATA>)
```

Data here is a row from the registry search - it is not shown here for brevity but all the metadata data to describe and load the function is saved to registry.

```python
from funkyprompt.model import FunctionDescription
#data = a row from the store with the fuction of interest
fd = FunctionDescription.restore(data['metadata'])
fd.function #<- this is the callable function that the LLM can use
```

```python
fd.function("Where did sinbad eventually settle down?")
```

This function can be thus searched and used by an LLM.
