# 1. Ingesting data into a new instance

{% hint style="info" %}
The guides below are for fprompt install to your system. You can also run with poetry in which case prefix all commands with `poetry run` \<COMMAND>
{% endhint %}

You have [installed](../why-funkyprompt/install.md) the library and set your environment variables to make sure you have a storage configuration. While you can query existing data i.e. ask LLM questions about things that can be answered by existing functions and data, its more interesting to choose your own data. Choose your adventure

1. Ingest unstructured data from a webpage such as this one
2. Ingest structured data from any page with JSON+LD embedded

{% hint style="info" %}
The commands are the same except we assume that the data are unstructured if there is no JSON+LD on the page.
{% endhint %}

### 1 Unstructured data

Unstructured data can be ingested into a named store by just pointing to a web page. You can then investigate indexes over your. See the notebooks to explore viz etc

&#x20;&#x20;

```bash
fprompt ingest page -u "http://"
```

### 2 Structured data

{% hint style="info" %}
This section requires that you have configure a module repo where functions and entities can be saved. If you clone funkyprompt then this will be in the examples module but if you are running funkyprompt as a library you must point this somewhere that you are happy to generate code into
{% endhint %}

The best way to do this is to first initialize a type and then think about what you want your type to look like

```bash
fprompt ingest init -u "https://" -n Recipe
```

This will use the LLM to generate a Pydantic schema and save it in the default namespace using the type name that you specify

Now you can optionally edit the Pydantic class which is save to your configure repo store and then you can infest into this type. This works as a crawler to pull down similar objects from the site

```bash
fprompt ingest entity -n Recipe --limit 10 
```

***

Whichever route you took, you now have a store of data and you can ask questions of it. By default the agent will load all CRUD functions in your repo which only makes sense when there are not many i.e. the first time.  To learn more about creating different plans you can had over to [Broken link](broken-reference "mention") but in the meantime you can query your data either ask about one of the recipes or about the unstructured data you loaded

```
fprompt query -q "Can you tell me how to make X"
```

In this section we used `fprompt` from terminal but you can import `funkyprompt` into a library to interact with it or use the notebooks. We will see many examples of that later.



### Things to thing about next

The focus here from the beginning is on [RAG](../why-funkyprompt/rag-systems.md) systems so we emphasize data and having your own data stores from the beginning. `funkyprompt` will make it easier to index and organize lots of data so you can experiment more easily.&#x20;



```python
def my_function(str: 
```
