PLANNING_PROMPT = f"""Below is a schema for building a plan.
        I would like you to consider the functions provided and build a plan to solve the task.
        You should break the problem down into steps and consider;
        (a) what functions can be used in each step matching the correct entity to the most suitable function 
        (b) what strategy to use in each step
        (c) how results from one step can be embedded as questions to the next.
        
        Functions that can be called without other dependencies can have empty dependency list and only functions that need the result of another function should depend on the other function.
        When calling functions in later states, you should always pass the shared context or known entities as parameters to the stage.
            - For example if entities are needed in other stages, they should be passed in as parameters in later stages.
        When passing data from one step to the next we can embed data in the question. 
            - For example if we got a collection of data from one or more steps, we could ask a question such as given the data [insert data] [ask the question]
